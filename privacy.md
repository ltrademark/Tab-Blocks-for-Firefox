# Privacy Policy for Tab Blocks

**Last Updated:** May 2, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Tab Blocks" Firefox extension handles your information.

**1. Data Storage:**

* **Local Storage:** All your created collections and saved links (including their URLs, titles, favicon URLs, and collapsed state) are stored **only locally on your computer** using the browser's standard `browser.storage.local` API.
* **No External Transmission:** This data is **not sent to any external servers** or third parties. It remains entirely within your browser's local storage for the extension.

**2. Permissions Used:**

* **`tabs` Permission:** This permission is used solely to:
    * List your currently open tabs in the sidebar.
    * Retrieve the title, URL, and favicon URL when you drag a tab to save it as a link block.
    * This information about open tabs is **not stored** by the extension, except for the specific details you choose to save by dragging a tab into a collection.
* **`storage` Permission:** This permission is required to save your collections and links locally on your device so they persist between browser sessions.
* **`downloads` Permission:** This permission is used only when you explicitly click the "Export" button to save your configuration file to your computer. The extension does not initiate downloads otherwise.

**3. Data You Provide:**

* **Collections and Links:** You create collection names and link titles. You add links by dragging tabs. This information is stored locally as described above.
* **Imported Data:** When you use the "Import" feature, the extension reads the selected JSON file (either native format or Toby format) to populate your collections. This data is then stored locally.

**4. Data Usage:**

The data stored locally is used exclusively to provide the core functionality of the Tab Blocks extension: displaying your collections and links on the new tab page, allowing you to organize them, and enabling the import/export features.

**5. Data Security:**

While the data is stored locally, standard browser security measures apply. However, be aware that anyone with access to your browser profile could potentially access the extension's local storage.

**6. Changes to This Policy:**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated version of the extension.
